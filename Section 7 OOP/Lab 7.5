Given main(), complete the Artist class (in files Artist.h and Artist.cpp) with constructors to initialize an artist's information, get member functions, and a PrintInfo() member function. The default constructor should initialize the artist's name to "unknown" and the years of birth and death to -1. PrintInfo() displays "Artist:", then a space, then the artist's name, then another space, then the birth and death dates in one of three formats:

(XXXX to YYYY) if both the birth and death years are nonnegative
(XXXX to present) if the birth year is nonnegative and the death year is negative
(unknown) otherwise
Complete the Artwork class (in files Artwork.h and Artwork.cpp) with constructors to initialize an artwork's information, get member functions, and a PrintInfo() member function. The default constructor should initialize the title to "unknown", the year created to -1. PrintInfo() displays an artist's information by calling the PrintInfo() function in the Artist class, followed by the artwork's title and the year created. Declare a private field of type Artist in the Artwork class.

Ex: If the input is:

Pablo Picasso
