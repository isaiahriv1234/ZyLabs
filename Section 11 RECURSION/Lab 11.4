Write a recursive function called DigitCount() that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns the number of digits in the integer. Hint: The digit count increases by 1 whenever the input number is divided by 10.

Ex: If the input is:

345
the function DigitCount() returns and the program outputs:

3
