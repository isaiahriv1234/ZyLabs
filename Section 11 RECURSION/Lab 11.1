We have a number of bunnies and each bunny has two big floppy ears. We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies recursively (without loops or multiplication).

bunnyEars(0) → 0
bunnyEars(1) → 2
bunnyEars(2) → 4

Hint:
You must solve this with recursion: no loops or formula solutions please!!


First detect the base case (bunnies == 0), and in that case just return 0.
Otherwise, make a recursive call to bunnyEars(bunnies-1).
Trust that the recursive call returns the correct value, and fix it up by adding 2.

Does your solution have a * symbol in it? That's cheating!! Go back and redo it using recursion ;)
