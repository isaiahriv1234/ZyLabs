Write a recursive function called ReverseString() that takes in a string as a parameter and returns the string in reversed order. The main function is provided to read a string from the user and call the ReverseString() function.

Ex: If the input of the program is:

Hello
the ReverseString() function returns and the program outputs:

Reverse of "Hello" is "olleH".
Ex: If the input of the program is:

Hello, world!
the ReverseString() function returns and the program outputs:

Reverse of "Hello, world!" is "!dlrow ,olleH".
Hint: Move the first character to the end of the returning string and pass the remaining sub-string to the next ReverseString() function call.
