Given a vector of ints, compute recursively the number of times that the value 11 appears in the vector . We'll use the convention of considering only the part of the vector that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1 to move down the vector . The initial call will pass in index as 0.

vector 11([1, 2, 11], 0) → 1
vector 11([11, 11], 0) → 2
vector 11([1, 2, 3, 4], 0) → 0
