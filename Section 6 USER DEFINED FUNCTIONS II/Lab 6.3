An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of words in a set phrase. Define a function named CreateAcronym that takes a string parameter and returns the acronym of the string parameter. Append a period (.) after each letter in the acronym. If a word begins with a lower case letter, don't include that letter in the acronym. Then write a main program that reads a phrase from input, calls CreateAcronym() with the input phrase as argument, and outputs the returned acronym. Assume the input has at least one upper case letter.

Ex: If the input is:

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
the output should be:

I.E.E.E.
Ex: If the input is:

Association for computing MACHINERY
the output should be:

A.M.
Although the letters ACHINERY in MACHINERY are upper case, those letters are omitted for being a part of the word MACHINERY.

The program must define and call a function:
string CreateAcronym(string userPhrase)

Hint: Use isupper() to check if a letter is upper case.
