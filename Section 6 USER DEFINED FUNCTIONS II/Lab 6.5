Write the InOrder() function, which receives a vector of integers as a parameter, and returns true if the numbers are sorted in descending order (in order from high to low) or false otherwise. The program outputs "In descending order" if the vector is sorted, or "Not in order" if the vector is not sorted.

Ex: If the vector passed to the InOrder() function is [5, 6, 7, 8, 3], then the function returns false and the program outputs:

Not in order
Ex: If the vector passed to the InOrder() function is [10, 8, 7, 6, 5], then the function returns true and the program outputs:

In descending order
