Define a function named SortVector that takes a vector of integers as a parameter. SortVector() modifies the vector parameter by sorting the elements in descending order (highest to lowest). Then write a main program that reads a list of integers from input, stores the integers (starting from the second integer) in a vector, calls SortVector(), and outputs the sorted vector. The first input integer indicates how many numbers are in the list.

Ex: If the input is:

5 10 4 39 12 2
the output is:

39,12,10,4,2,
For coding simplicity, follow every output value by a comma, including the last one.

Your program must define and call the following function:
void SortVector(vector<int>& myVec)

Hint: Sorting a vector can be done in many ways. You are welcome to look up and use any existing algorithm. Some believe the simplest to code is bubble sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort. But you are welcome to try others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm.
