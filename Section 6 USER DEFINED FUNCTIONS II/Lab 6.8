Define a function named SwapValues that takes four integers as parameters and swaps the first with the second, and the third with the fourth values. Then write a main program that reads four integers from input and calls function SwapValues() to swap the input values. The main program then prints the swapped values on a single line separated with spaces and ending with a newline.

The program must define and call the following function:
void SwapValues(int& userVal1, int& userVal2, int& userVal3, int& userVal4)

Ex: If the input is:

3 8 2 4
function SwapValues() stores 8, 3, 4, and 2 in userVal1, userVal2, userVal3, and userVal4, respectively. The main program then outputs:

8 3 4 2
Function SwapValues() swaps the values referenced by the parameters and does not print any output.
