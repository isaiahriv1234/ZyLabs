(1) Write a program that prompts a user to enter an abbreviation. If the user's input string matches a known text message abbreviation, output the unabbreviated form, else output: Unknown. Support two abbreviations: LOL -- laughing out loud, and IDK -- I don't know. (4 pts)

If the input is:

LOL
the output is:

Input an abbreviation:
laughing out loud
If the input is:

TTYL
the output is:

Input an abbreviation:
Unknown
Note: The strings "LOL" and "TTYL" are not present in the display of the zyBook environment because both strings are inputs and therefore not part of the program output.


(2) Expand to also decode these abbreviations. (3 pts)

BFF -- best friends forever
IMHO -- in my humble opinion
TMI -- too much information
