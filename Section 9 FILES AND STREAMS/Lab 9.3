Complete main() to read dates from input, one date per line. Each date's format must be as follows: March 1, 1990. Any date not following that format is incorrect and should be ignored. Use the substr() function to parse the string and extract the date. The input ends with -1 on a line alone. Output each correct date as: 3-1-1990.

Ex: If the input is:

March 1, 1990
April 2 1995
7/15/20
December 13, 2003
-1
then the output is:

3-1-1990
12-13-2003
Use the provided GetMonthAsInt() function to convert a month string to an integer. If the month string is valid, an integer in the range 1 to 12 inclusive is returned, otherwise 0 is returned. Ex: GetMonthAsInt("February") returns 2 and GetMonthAsInt("7/15/20") returns 0.
