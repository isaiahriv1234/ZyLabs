Forms often allow a user to enter an integer. Write a program that takes in a string representing an integer as input, and outputs Yes if every character is a digit 0-9.

Ex: If the input is:

1995
the output is:

Yes
Ex: If the input is:

42,000
or

1995!
the output is:

No
Hint: Use a loop and the isdigit() function (don't forget to include the cctype library).
