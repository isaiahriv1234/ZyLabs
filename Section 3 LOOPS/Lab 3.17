Write a program that takes three integers as input: low, high, and x. The program then outputs the number of multiples of x between low and high exclusive.

Ex: If the input is:

1 10 2
the output is:

Multiples of 2: 2,4,6,8,
For coding simplicity, follow each output number by a comma, even the last one.

Hint: Use the % operator to determine if a number is a multiple of x. Use a for loop to test each number between low and high.
