Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data. Write a program that takes any number of non-negative integers as input, and outputs the max and average. A negative integer ends the input and is not included in the statistics. Assume the input contains at least one non-negative integer.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: When the input is:

15 20 0 3 -1
the output is:

20 9.50
