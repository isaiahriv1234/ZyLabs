Given a sorted list of integers, output the middle integer. A negative number indicates the end of the input (the negative number is not a part of the sorted list). Assume the number of integers is always odd.

Ex: If the input is:

2 3 4 8 11 -1 
the output is:

Middle item: 4
The maximum number of list values for any test case should not exceed 9. If exceeded, output "Too many numbers".

Hint: First read the data into a vector. Then, based on the number of items, find the middle item.
