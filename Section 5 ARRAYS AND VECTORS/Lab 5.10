Write a program that accepts as input 12 integers. Read the numbers into an a 2D integer array with 4 rows and 3 columns, then output the numbers in reverse order.

Ex: If the input is:

5 7 3
6 4 3
5 6 9
5 2 8
then the output is:

8 2 5 
9 6 5 
3 4 6 
3 7 5 
For coding simplicity, output a space after every integer, including the last one on each row.
