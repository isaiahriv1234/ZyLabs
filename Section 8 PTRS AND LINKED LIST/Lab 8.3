In this lab you will develop the destructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator (the Big 3) for a very simple class that contains a pointer to dynamically allocated memory.

The DynamicMemoryClass is very similar to the DynNum class discussed in lecture. You should refer to those slides in Lecture 8 to solve this problem. However, if you want to really understand the issues related to the correct (and incorrect) coding for these 3 important functions, you should make sure to watch the lecture video covering this topic.

For this lab, the main function is READ ONLY. To solve this zyLab, please

Run the program as is to view the results of using the automatically provided versions of the Big 3 functions
Notice how the copy objects are entangled or aliased (changing one changes the other)
Now uncomment the prototypes for the Big 3 in DynamicMemoryClass.h
Then, define these functions in DynamicMemoryClass.cpp
Follow the instructions given in the lecture slides, lecture video, and the comments provided.
When the Big 3 are defined correctly, your program will pass the tests.
