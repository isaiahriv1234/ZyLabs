A pedometer treats walking 1 step as walking 2.5 feet. Define a function named FeetToSteps that takes a double as a parameter, representing the number of feet walked, and returns the number of steps walked as an integer by type casting. Then, write a main program that reads the number of feet walked as an input, calls function FeetToSteps() with the input as an argument, and outputs the number of steps returned from FeetToSteps().

Use floating-point arithmetic to perform the conversion.

Note: Type casting a double to an integer may affect the result's accuracy.

Ex: If the input is:

150.5
the output is:

60
The program must define and call a function:
int FeetToSteps(double userFeet)
