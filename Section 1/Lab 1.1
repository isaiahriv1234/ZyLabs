Welcome to Advanced zyLabs! 

This training lab demonstrates some of the primary functionalities within Advanced zyLabs.

To start, click on the earmarked page icon on the upper left of the zyLabs editor to open the Files pane, which lists all files within the current workspace. Notice that main.cpp is labeled with a padlock. Files labeled with this padlock icon are read-only, and thus cannot be edited. main.cpp contains the program of this lab, but the contents of main.cpp need not be understood at this moment.

Next, click the plus icon at the top of the Files pane to create a new text file. Name the new text file hello.txt. Within the new text file, enter the following phrase:

Hello, World!

NOTE: Be sure that all capitalization and punctuation are exactly as shown!

Now, click on the green Run button above the editor window to run the main.cpp program. 

The console window just below the editor window is where program output, if any, will be shown. The console is also where input can be entered, should a program require user input. The main.cpp program is expecting the user to input the name of a file, then the program will output the contents of said file. Type the name of the file, hello.txt, in the console window and press Enter on your keyboard.

If the output within the console matches the phrase "Hello, World!", the lab is now ready to be submitted. To do so, click on the Submit for grading button. Three points should be awarded for proper completion of this lab.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    string fileName;

    // Get the name of the input file
    cin >> fileName;

    // Open the input file
    ifstream file(fileName);

    // Print contents of input file
    if(file.is_open()) {
        cout << file.rdbuf();
    }

    // Close the input file
    file.close();

    return 0;
}
