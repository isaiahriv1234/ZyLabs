Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's gas mileage (miles/gallon) and the cost of gas (dollars/gallon) as floating-point input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements. Note: End with a newline.

Ex: If the input is:

25.0 3.1599
where the gas mileage is 25.0 miles/gallon and the cost of gas is $3.1599/gallon, the output is:

2.53 9.48 63.20
Note: Real per-mile cost would also include maintenance and depreciation.
