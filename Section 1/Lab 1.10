Most zyLabs are designed to be completed in 20 - 25 minutes and emphasize a single concept. However, some zyLabs (such as the one large program or OLP) are more comprehensive and may take longer to complete.

Incremental development is a good programming practice and is the process of writing, compiling, and testing a small amount of code, then repeating the process with a small amount more (an incremental amount), and so on.

Suggested process to complete longer zyLabs:

Implement Step 1 and submit for grading. Only one test will pass.
Continue to implement one step at a time and resubmit for grading. At least one additional test should pass after each step.
Continue until all steps are completed and all tests pass.
Program Specifications For practice with incremental development, write a program to output three statements as specified.

Step 1 (4 pts). Use cout to output "Step 1 complete". Submit for grading to confirm one of three tests passes.

Output should be:

Step 1 complete

Step 2 (3 pts). Use cout to output "Step 2 as well". Submit for grading to confirm two of three tests pass.

Output should be:

Step 1 complete
Step 2 as well

Step 3 (3 pts). Use cout to output "All steps now complete". Submit for grading to confirm all tests pass.

Output should be:

Step 1 complete
Step 2 as well
All steps now complete
